Hello! I am **Zonglin Yang**, a second-year Ph.D. candidate at Nanyang Technological University supervised by [Erik Cambria](https://sentic.net/erikcambria/). I also work closely with [Soujanya Poria](https://soujanyaporia.github.io/). Before NTU, I obtained my master's degree at Cornell University, supervised by [Claire Cardie](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/) and [Xinya Du](https://xinyadu.github.io/), and my bachelor's degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/). I have interned at Microsoft Research in NLC group mentored by [Li Dong](http://dong.li/).



<!--I am open to academic collaborations and please drop me an email (<zonglin.yang@ntu.edu.sg>) if you are interested in collaborating with me.-->
<!--**I am actively seeking internship opportunities in 2024. If you have any openings available, kindly reach out to me via email (<zonglin.yang@ntu.edu.sg>).**-->
I am actively seeking internship opportunities (spring 2025, summer 2025), as well as full-time employment starting from June, 2025. If you have any openings available, kindly reach out to me via email (<zonglin.yang@ntu.edu.sg>).


Research
======
My current research interests are:  
* Alignment of LLMs (current research project).
* LLMs for Scientific Discovery ([Inductive Reasoning for Social Science](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02726.pdf)).
* Reasoning & Knowledge in Natural Language Processing ([Inductive Reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-long.13/), [Logical Reasoning Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12023.pdf), [Case-based Reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.255/), [Temporal Commonsense Reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.302/)).

More specifically about my past research:

(1) Bridging research between classic AI (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) and Natural Language Processing, e.g., [Inductive Reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-long.13/) and [Case-based Reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.255/).

(2) A [Further Work on Inductive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02726.pdf) that leverage LLM agents to generate initial novel scientific hypotheses to assist scientists.

(3) A [Survey on Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12023.pdf) over Natural Language as Knowledge Representation.  
<!-- It surveys papers under a new paradigm of logical reasoning that uses natural language as knowledge representation and PLMs as reasoners. In contrast, in the classic AI research of logical reasoning, formal language is used as knowledge representation, and symbolic methods are used as reasoners.   -->

<!-- ![Alt text](https://github.com/ZonglinY/ZonglinY.github.io/blob/master/images/LRNL.pdf) -->

(4) Improving [Temporal Commonsense Reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.302/) via distant supervision.



<!-- My primary research goal is to apply Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing and develop **Language Technology for All**. To achievethis goal and make language technology accessible in most peopleâ€™s lives, I identify two major research topics that Iâ€™m interested in: **efficiency** and **trustworthiness** of NLP models. Efficiency involves both the amount of **computation** and **data** required for (pre-)training and using NLP models. Trustworthiness involves the **interpretability**, **fairness**, and **robustness** with respect to adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution samples.  

Specifically I am interested in the following research topics:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Natural language generation, creative text generation, evaluation for NLG models.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Commonsense reasoning and knowledge-based reasoning.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Robust NLP models for OOD samples and reducing spurious dataset biases.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Interpretability, explainability, biases, and fairness for NLP models.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Green NLP, Low resource NLP, and Learning NLP models from high-level supervision**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Multi-modality**   -->
